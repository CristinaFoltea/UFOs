# UFOs

Interactive webpage that allow readers to parse the data around UFO sightings using HTML, CSS, Javascript, d3 and Bootstrap. The user has the ability to filter by date, city, state, country and shape. And as bonus the user has the ability to clear all filter at a button click.

As further development I would offer also a map view beside the existing table view.
