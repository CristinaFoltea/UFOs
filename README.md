# UFOs

Interactive webpage that allows readers to view the data around UFO sightings. The user has ability to filter the data by date, city,state, country and object shape. And as a bonus a clear filter was added to give the user a easy way to clear any existing filters.

As further development I would offer also a map view beside the existing table view. 

## Technologies used:

HTML, CSS, Javascript, d3 and Bootstrap
