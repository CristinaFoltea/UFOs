# UFOs

An interactive webpage that allows readers to view the data around UFO sightings. The user has the ability to filter the data by date, city, state, country and object shape. And as a bonus, a clear filter was added to give the user an easy way to clear existing filters.

As a further development, I would offer a map view beside the existing table view.

## Technologies used:

HTML, CSS, Javascript, d3 and Bootstrap
